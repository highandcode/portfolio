    "about": " As an associate full stack developer with two years of experience, I have worked with a variety of popular technologies including Reactjs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, YAML, Sass, UNIX and Git. Through this work, I have honed my problem-solving skills and developed a deep curiosity for learning new technologies. \n\n\n I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to deploy an application on aws, aling with learning linux and more.",
